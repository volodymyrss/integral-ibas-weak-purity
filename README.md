# INTEGRAL IBAS WEAK alert stream purity

As extracted from https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/integral_grbs.html.

See [IBAS_Weak.ipynb](IBAS_Weak.ipynb) for the analysis.

IBAS Weak stream usually filters out the main ghosts, but misses secondary ones, which are prominent in the case
Overall, crude estimate reveals up to 30% of the Weak alerts are suspiciously clustered around ISGRI PSF side-lobes, considering only individual sources (i.e. the percentages add-up to a degree).
More detail analysis would remove some of the flags and add others.
It is likely that Galactic Center region has higher contamination. An estimate will take a more time.
