# INTEGRAL IBAS WEAK alert stream purity

See [IBAS_Weak.ipynb](IBAS_Weak.ipynb) for the analysis.

IBAS Weak stream usually filters out the main ghosts, but misses secondary ones, which are prominent in the case
Overall, crude estimate reveals that 50% (typical single known source ) - 80% (rarely flaring source) of the Weak alerts are suspiciously clustered around ISGRI PSF side-lobes.
More detail analysis would remove some of the flags and add others.
It is likely that Galactic Center region has higher contamination. An estimate will take a marginally more time.
